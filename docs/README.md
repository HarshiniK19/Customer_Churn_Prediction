Bank Customer Churn Prediction
1. Project Objective

Purpose:
The goal of this project is to predict which bank customers are likely to churn in the next 3 months. This will enable the bank to take proactive steps to retain customers, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize marketing campaigns.

Problem Statement:

“Predict which bank customers are likely to churn in the next 3 months using demographic and account-related data, to improve retention strategies and business decisions.”
